      <description>The first thing that I did when learning R was run some random simulations. It was a great way to quickly get familiar with R’s base data structures and functions without needing to load data into R. I have also found it very useful for creating sample data and coming up with quick confidence levels.
Before you start generating random numbers, it is a good idea to set the seed so that your simulations will be reproducible.</description>

      <description>A Single Frequency/Severity Observation We will start by running one frequency severity simulation. We will first simulate the frequency (i.e. the number of claims), and then we will simulate a severity for each simulated claim.
Step 1: simulate a single frequency We are using the poisson distriubtion to simulate the frequency. The poisson distribution has one parameter (lambda). Both the mean and the variance of the poisson distribution are equal to lambda.</description>
