I am a property and casualty actuary living in Atlanta, GA. I believe most serious data analysis should be done in an environment like R's rather than on a spreadsheet; I hope RActuary will help other actuaries in their transition from spreadsheets to programmed data analysis.

I love to learn, and I constantly experiment with alternate ways to improve my workflow. Since I started using R, I have been cycling through a state of ignorance, learning, and then discovering new areas in which I am completely ignorant. It has been a fun experience, and I am hopeful more and more actuaries will see R as the powerful tool I believe it is. I am looking forward to sharing some of the things I have learned and whatever I happen to learn in the future with whoever finds it interesting or useful.
